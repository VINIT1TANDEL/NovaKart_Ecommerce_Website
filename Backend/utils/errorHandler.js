        Error.captureStackTrace(this,this.constructor);//This method helps in keeping track of where the error was created in the code, which is very helpful for debugging. Itâ€™s customizing the stack trace, so it points only to where this particular type of error (ErrorHandler) was instantiated, not from inside the Error class itself.
